<h1>Freed from desire</h1>
<p>My love has got no money, he's got his strong beliefs<br>
    My love has got no power, he's got his strong beliefs<br>
    My love has got no fame, he's got his strong beliefs<br>
    My love has got no money, he's got his strong beliefs<br>

    [Pre-Chorus]<br>
    Want more and more, people just want more and more<br>
    Freedom and love, what he's looking for<br>
    Want more and more, people just want more and more<br>
    Freedom and love, what he's looking for<br>

    [Chorus]<br>
    Freed from desire, mind and senses purified<br>
    Freed from desire, mind and senses purified<br>
    Freed from desire, mind and senses purified<br>
    Freed from desire<br>
